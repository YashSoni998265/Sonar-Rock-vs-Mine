# 🎯 Sonar Rock vs Mine Prediction using Logistic Regression

This Deep Learning project aims to classify sonar signals as either **Rock** or **Mine** using the **Sonar Dataset**. The dataset contains 60 features based on the energy of sonar signals bounced off different objects. This binary classification problem is solved using **Logistic Regression**, and all essential steps including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation have been covered.

> ✅ **Dataset is attached with this repository** for easy access and replication.

🚀 Workflow
1. 📦 Importing the Dependencies
All necessary Python libraries like pandas, numpy, sklearn, and matplotlib are imported to perform data analysis, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.

2. 🧹 Data Collection and Preprocessing
Loaded the sonar dataset.

Converted labels from categorical to binary (R = Rock, M = Mine).

Normalized/Standardized the data as needed.

Split the dataset into training and testing sets (stratified sampling).

3. 🧠 Model Training
Used Logistic Regression from sklearn.linear_model to train on the sonar dataset. This simple yet effective algorithm is well-suited for binary classification tasks like this one.

4. 📊 Model Evaluation
Evaluated the model on both training and test data.

Calculated accuracy scores and printed classification results.

Visualized model performance (optional based on code).

5. 🔮 Making a Predictive System
Created a system that:

Accepts new input data,

Processes it,

Predicts whether the object is a Rock or a Mine based on sonar readings.
