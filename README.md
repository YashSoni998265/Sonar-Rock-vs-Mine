# ðŸŽ¯ Sonar Rock vs Mine Prediction using Logistic Regression

This Deep Learning project aims to classify sonar signals as either **Rock** or **Mine** using the **Sonar Dataset**. The dataset contains 60 features based on the energy of sonar signals bounced off different objects. This binary classification problem is solved using **Logistic Regression**, and all essential steps including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation have been covered.

> âœ… **Dataset is attached with this repository** for easy access and replication.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

```bash
Sonar-Rock-vs-Mine/
â”œâ”€â”€ sonar.csv                # ðŸ“Š The sonar dataset (attached)
â”œâ”€â”€ sonar_prediction.py     # ðŸ§  Model training and prediction code
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                # ðŸ“˜ Project overview

ðŸš€ Workflow
1. ðŸ“¦ Importing the Dependencies
All necessary Python libraries like pandas, numpy, sklearn, and matplotlib are imported to perform data analysis, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.

2. ðŸ§¹ Data Collection and Preprocessing
Loaded the sonar dataset.

Converted labels from categorical to binary (R = Rock, M = Mine).

Normalized/Standardized the data as needed.

Split the dataset into training and testing sets (stratified sampling).

3. ðŸ§  Model Training
Used Logistic Regression from sklearn.linear_model to train on the sonar dataset. This simple yet effective algorithm is well-suited for binary classification tasks like this one.

4. ðŸ“Š Model Evaluation
Evaluated the model on both training and test data.

Calculated accuracy scores and printed classification results.

Visualized model performance (optional based on code).

5. ðŸ”® Making a Predictive System
Created a system that:

Accepts new input data,

Processes it,

Predicts whether the object is a Rock or a Mine based on sonar readings.
